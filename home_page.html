  <h1>What is LCA?</h1>
  <div class="b"> LCA is a standardized, science-based tool for quantifying the impact in order to assess lifetime environmental impact. 
    It takes a lifetime perspective. LCA takes into consideration all the steps that lead from raw material through manufacture, distribution and usage to final disposal.<br>

    <h2>Life-cycle assessment stages</h2><br>
    
    <li> <b>Material Production Stage:</b> It involves acquiring all the necessary materials for the building of paves. At this point, environmental burdens are produced by all processes in extracting and processing materials such as mining, refining, production, etc.</li><br>
      <li><b>Construction Stage:</b> The construction phase covers all the procedures involved in building new pavements. Delays in the transport of traffic, in-house installations and materials, formation and mixing etc. are the main reasons for the environmental burden in this phase.</li><br>

        <li> <b>Use Stage:</b> In this phase, the paving is accessible to traffic and interacts with the vehicles and the environment. Vehicle activity, illumination, carbonation, and other factors have a significant effect on the atmosphere during this process.</li><br>

          <li> <b>Maintenance/Preservation Stage:</b> There are tasks that are carried out at different times in the pavement's life to keep it in good working order. Adverse environmental effects in this case are similar to those of material production and construction phase.</li><br>

            <li> <b>End-of-Life Stage:</b> The end-of-life stage refers to the pavement subsequent recycle, reuse, treatment or recycling, after its useful life has reached its peak. The environmental impacts in this stage are caused by the transportation of materials after demolition, land filling, processes involved in recycling materials etc.</li><br>
            
            <h2>Steps for Pavement LCA</h2><br> 1.	Firstly, the goal of the LCA study was determined. The goal should state the reason for conducting the LCA, like comparison of two pavement construction techniques etc.<br><br>
2.	Then the scope of the study was finalized. The scope of the study consists:-<br><br>
<li>	Functional Unit:- In each of the product or service's life-cycle phases, the functional unit specifies the device that will be studied and serves as a guide for scaling input and output data (Kendall and Santero 2010). Functional unit represents the physical dimension like length, width, number of lanes etc. Pavement functional units, for example, are often expressed in lane-km or lane-mile and must run for a specified period of time.</li> <br><br>
For comparing the LCA of two pavements, they should be in the same functional unit for the precise comparison.</li><br><br>
<li>	System Boundary:- This includes the determination of the unit process which is the smallest element that is considered in the functional unit for the LCA study and the cutoff criterion which decides whether to exclude any process on the basis of its impact on the environment. For example, while comparing the LCA of two different pavements, if any life stage or any process is expected to show similar results than that life stage or process can be excluded from the study. <br><br>
3.	After defining the goal and scope of the study, then relevant data for performing LCA was collected.</li><br><br>
The data collected should be within the system boundary. Following data was collected for the study of each pavement after deciding the life span and the maintenance period of the pavement to be constructed:-</li><br><br>
<li>	Data collected for material production stage.</li><br><br>
<li>	Data collected for material transportation stage.</li><br><br>
<li>	Data collected construction stage.</li><br><br>
<li>	Data collected for future maintenance and Rehabilitation stage.</li><br><br>
<li>	Data collected for the end of life stage.</li><br><br>
All these stages consist of data such as the volume of materials in different layers of the pavement and its transportation distance from the plant to the site for both initial construction and maintenance stage. The quantity of fossil fuel used during the construction stage and transportation stage by the vehicles. The type of equipment and vehicle used for construction and hauling purposes. The future traffic volume and the traffic growth rate for the use phase and finally the recycling, reusing and landfilling data after the end of life stage.<br><br>



4.	After the data collection part, the last stage was to perform LCA of the pavements with their respective data collected in the earlier step to determine their environmental impacts and compare the results. <br><br>
