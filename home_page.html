  <h1>What is LCA?</h1>
  <div class="b"> LCA is a standardized, science-based tool for quantifying the impact in order to assess lifetime environmental impact. 
    It takes a lifetime perspective. LCA takes into consideration all the steps that lead from raw material through manufacture, distribution and usage to final disposal.<br>

    <h2>Life-cycle assessment stages</h2><br>
   <li> It provides both the big picture and the fine details: An LCA can both measure a buildingâ€™s lifetime impacts and, at the same time, quantify the impact of a single material in the building.</li><br>
   <li>It is science-based and covers a wide range of environmental impacts. Calculating greenhouse gas emissions (or a carbon footprint) is just one dimension of an LCA, which can also assess impacts such as ozone depletion, eutrophication, impact on human health and much more.</li><br>
  <li>It is underpinned by international standards. Results obtained via an LCA can be trusted as they are based on international standards, ISOs 14040 and 14044. This helps to ensure consistency, reliability and independence from commercial pressure.</li><br>
